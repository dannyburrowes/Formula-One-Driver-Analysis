# F1 Driver Analysis
## Introduction
The Formula One grid is comprised of 10 teams, each with 2 drivers, making a total of 20 drivers. Each team has 2 identical cars for its drivers, meaning that there are 10 unique racecars on the grid. Inter-team differences in car performance can, and ususally are massive, with some cars dominating the front of the field and others consistenly finishing at the pack of the pack, regardless of the combination of drivers they have piloting their machines. Driver skill undoubtedly plays a big role in where a driver finishes, however, given that this is the world's premier class of motor racing, it is safe to assume that all drivers possess a certain (extremely high) level of competency. Thus, racecar performance is likely the largest single factor that influences a driver's finishing position in Formula One. The following chart shows the average finishing position of each team (an aggregate of their 2 drivers) across the 2022 F1 season. Here, it can be seen that the inter-team differences are often extremely large, with Red Bull averaging just over 2nd place and Williams averaging just over 12th place.

Due to the large discrepancies in racecar performance, I wanted to create a tool that could be used to accurately assess driver performance whilst removing the influence of the quality of their machinery. This project is an interactive tool that enables the user to analyse any same-team driver pairing from certain seasons and compare performances against one another using a data visualisation dashboard. Performance can be compared on a number of different metrics, including: finishing position, qualifying positions and times, race fastest laps and aggregate statistics of those disciplines.

## Project aims
The aim of this project is to:
1. Analyse the race finishing positions, qualifying positions, fastest laps (within race), race pace, qualifying pace (throughout all sessions) for every driver.
2. Isolate the influence of driver skill as much as possible by offering comparisons between teammates (drivers with identical cars) only.
3. Analyse results from every driver pairing in every season since Formula One began in 1950.
4. Create meaningful and aesthetic visualisations to clearly showcase driver performance.
