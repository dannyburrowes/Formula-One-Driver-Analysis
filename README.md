# F1 Driver Analysis
## About
This app analyses Formula One driver performance in any given season and presents the information in a simple data visualisation dashboard. Drivers are compared to only their teammates to eliminate the the influence of racecar performance and isolate driver performance as much as possible.
## Project aims
The aim of this project is to:
1. Analyse the race finishing positions, qualifying positions, fastest laps (within race), race pace, qualifying pace (throughout all sessions) for every driver.
2. Isolate the influence of driver skill as much as possible by offering comparisons between teammates (drivers with identical cars) only.
3. Analyse results from every driver pairing in every season since Formula One began in 1950.
4. Create meaningful and aesthetic visualisations to clearly showcase driver performance.
